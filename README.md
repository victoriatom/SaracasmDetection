# Saracasm Detection

Sarcasm detection using a contrast between negative and positive sentiment, as done in a research project by the University of Utah. http://www.anthology.aclweb.org/D/D13/D13-1066.pdf. 

Streaming.py is used to pull live tweets from Twitter. POS tag.ipynb was used to process the tweets for input into SentimentAnalysis.ipynb, which handled the sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection aspect of our project.
